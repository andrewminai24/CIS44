Course Description This is an advanced course in the Java Programming Language. We will study basic data structures such as stacks, dynamic arrays, lists, and trees, and their implementation. We will also cover basic algorithm analysis techniques (Big-O notation and recurrences), and basic algorithms for searching and sorting. We will also briefly cover basic software engineering concepts to give you a feel for developing large software applications in the real world.

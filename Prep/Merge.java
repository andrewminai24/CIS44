/*
Merge Sort

1.In Merge sort, the idea of the algorithm is to sort smaller arrays
and then combine those arrays together (merge them) in sorted order.

2.Merge sort leverages recursion

Pseudocode:
1.Sort the left half of the array(assuming n > 1)
2.Sort the right half of the array(assuming n > 1)
3.Merge the two halves together

/*
First I want to set a variable of type Node
that would be called current so that I can I have
reference pointer to get me to the next node.
Next I want to have type T variable that will 
equal maxNum to null because at the beginning 
of the list always starts from null.
Second I want to have 
if statement defining what if there arent 
any max numbers and if the numbers = to 
null what will I do.In that if block I want to create a 
statement saying that MaxNum = current


public class Max{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Max();
	}
	public T findmax(){
